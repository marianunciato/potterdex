                            There is very little knowledge about Helga Hufflepuff's life, but it is said that she valued inclusion and accepted students who were not necessarily from pure magical families. She was also known for her ability to teach practical skills, such as herbology and cooking, and highly valued honesty and kindness in her students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to legend, Helga Hufflepuff possessed a great treasure, the Cup of Hufflepuff, which was passed down from generation to generation in her family. The cup is one of the objects that make up the set of magical objects known as the Deathly Hallows, which are extremely powerful and dangerous if not used correctly.
